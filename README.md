# Links
goodricke links site v2. Coming soon to a goodricke college near you. now with 100% more rust (actually theres a couple .toml and .md files but its like 99% rust).

this is a links site inspired by linktree. v1 had a few issues that needed fixing so instead of fixing them I decided to rewrite it from scratch. (no this isnt me procrasinating my degree, I dont do that)

## development

to run locally clone the repo then run `cargo run`. (you might need to install rust https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
